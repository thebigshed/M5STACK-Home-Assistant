# M5STACK-Home-Assistant

My attempt to make use of my old Gen 1 M5STACK on home assistant
the issue was getting the screen to work but after that it was all quite normal.

Page 1 - Solar and Battery
Page 2 - Network
Page 3 - Temperature
Page 4 - Temperature graph

The data is mostly from MQTT from other sensors
The Header is currently missing from the graph as I wanted more screen space.
